# Developer guide \- AWS SDK for Java 2\.x<a name="home"></a>

The AWS SDK for Java provides a Java API for AWS services\. Using the SDK, you can easily build Java applications that work with Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, DynamoDB, and more\.

The AWS SDK for Java 2\.x is a major rewrite of the version 1\.x code base\. It’s built on top of Java 8\+ and adds several frequently requested features\. These include support for non\-blocking I/O and the ability to plug in a different HTTP implementation at run time\. For more information see the [AWS blog](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/aws-sdk-for-java-2-0-developer-preview/)\.

We regularly add support for new services to the AWS SDK for Java\. For a list of changes and features in a particular version, view the [change log](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\.

## Get started with the SDK<a name="get-started-with-the-sdk-java-2-x"></a>

If you’re ready to get hands\-on with the SDK, follow the [Quick Start](get-started.md) tutorial\.

To set up your development environment, see [Setting up](setup.md)\.

If you’re currently using version 1\.x of the SDK for Java, see [Migrating to version 2](migration.md) for specific guidance\.

For information on making requests to Amazon S3, DynamoDB, Amazon EC2 and other AWS services, see [Using the SDK for Java](using.md) and [Working with AWS services](examples.md)\.
