# Developer Guide \- AWS SDK for Java 2\.x<a name="home"></a>

The AWS SDK for Java provides a Java API for AWS services\. Using the SDK, you can build Java applications that work with Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, DynamoDB, and more\.

The AWS SDK for Java 2\.x is a major rewrite of the version 1\.x code base\. It’s built on top of Java 8\+ and adds several frequently requested features\. These include support for non\-blocking I/O and the ability to plug in a different HTTP implementation at runtime\.

We regularly add support for new services to the AWS SDK for Java\. For a list of changes and features in a particular version, view the [change log](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\.
