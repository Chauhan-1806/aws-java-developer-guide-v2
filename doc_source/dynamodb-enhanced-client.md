# Using the DynamoDB Enhanced Client in the AWS SDK for Java 2\.x<a name="dynamodb-enhanced-client"></a>

The DynamoDB enhanced client is a high\-level library that is part of the AWS SDK for Java version 2 \(v2\)\. It offers a straightforward way to map client\-side classes to DynamoDB tables\. You define the relationships between tables and their corresponding model classes in your code\. After you define those relationships, you can intuitively perform various create, read, update, or delete \(CRUD\) operations on tables or items in DynamoDB\.
