# Using the DynamoDB Enhanced Client in the AWS SDK for Java 2\.x<a name="dynamodb-enhanced-client"></a>

The Amazon DynamoDB enhanced client is a high\-level library that is part of the AWS SDK for Java version 2 \(v2\)\. It offers a straightforward way to map client\-side classes to DynamoDB tables\. You define the relationships between tables and their corresponding model classes in your code\. Then you can intuitively perform various create, read, update, or delete \(CRUD\) operations on tables or items in DynamoDB\.

The AWS SDK for Java v2 includes a set of annotations that you can use with a Java bean to quickly generate a [TableSchema](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/reference/software/amazon/awssdk/enhanced/dynamodb/TableSchema.html) for mapping your classes to tables\. Alternatively, if you declare each [TableSchema](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/reference/software/amazon/awssdk/enhanced/dynamodb/TableSchema.html) explicitly, you donâ€™t need to include annotations in your classes\.
