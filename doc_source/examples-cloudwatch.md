# Working with CloudWatch<a name="examples-cloudwatch"></a>

This section provides examples of programming [CloudWatch](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) by using the AWS SDK for Java 2\.x\.

 Amazon CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services \(AWS\) resources and the applications you run on AWS in real time\. You can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which are variables you can measure for your resources and applications\. CloudWatch alarms send notifications or automatically make changes to the resources you are monitoring based on rules that you define\.

For more information about CloudWatch, see the [Amazon CloudWatch User Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/)\.

The following examples include only the code needed to demonstrate each technique\. The [complete example code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/javav2)\. From there, you can download a single source file or clone the repository locally to get all the examples to build and run\.
