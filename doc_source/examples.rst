   :description: Programming with Amazon Web Services with the AWS SDK for Java
   :keywords:

This section provides programming examples using the |sdk-java-v2| that applies
to specific use cases.

Find the source code for these examples and others in the |AWS| documentation 
`code examples repository on GitHub <https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples>`_.

To propose a new code example for the |AWS| documentation team to consider producing, 
create a new request. The team is looking to produce code examples that cover broader 
scenarios and use cases, versus simple code snippets that cover only individual API calls. 
For instructions, see the "Proposing new code examples" section in the 
`Readme on GitHub <https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/master/README.rst>`_.
