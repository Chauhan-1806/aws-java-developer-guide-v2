# Working with IAM<a name="examples-iam"></a>

This section provides examples of programming [IAM](http://aws.amazon.com/iam/) by using the AWS SDK for Java 2\.x\.

 AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) enables you to securely control access to AWS services and resources for your users\. Using IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources\. For a complete guide to IAM, visit the [IAM User Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/)\.

The following examples include only the code needed to demonstrate each technique\. The [complete example code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/javav2)\. From there, you can download a single source file or clone the repository locally to get all the examples to build and run\.
