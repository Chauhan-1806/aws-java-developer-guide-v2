# What's different between the AWS SDK for Java 1\.x and 2\.x<a name="migration-whats-different"></a>

This section describes the main changes to be aware of when converting an application from using the AWS SDK for Java version 1\.x to version 2\.x\.

## High\-Level libraries<a name="highlevel-libraries"></a>

High\-level libraries, such as the Amazon S3 Transfer Manager and the Amazon SQS Client\-side Buffering, are not yet available in version 2\.x\. See the AWS SDK for Java 2\.x [changelog](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/blob/master/docs/LaunchChangelog.md#7-high-level-libraries) for a complete list of libraries\.

If your application depends on these libraries, see [Using both SDKs side\-by\-side](migration-side-by-side.md) to learn how to configure your pom\.xml to use both 1\.x and 2\.x\. Refer to the AWS SDK for Java 2\.x [changelog](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/blob/master/docs/LaunchChangelog.md#7-high-level-libraries) for updates about these libraries\.

## Adding version 2\.x to Your Project<a name="adding-v2"></a>

Maven is the recommended way to manage dependencies when using the AWS SDK for Java 2\.x\. To add version 2 components to your project, simply update your pom\.xml file with a dependency on the SDK\.

**Example**  

```
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
          <groupId>software.amazon.awssdk</groupId>
          <artifactId>bom</artifactId>
          <version>2.16.1</version>
          <type>pom</type>
          <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>

<dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>software.amazon.awssdk</groupId>
      <artifactId>dynamodb</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

## Client builders<a name="client-builder"></a>

You must create all clients using the client builder method\. Constructors are no longer available\.

**Example of creating a client in version 1\.x**  

```
AmazonDynamoDB ddbClient = AmazonDynamoDBClientBuilder.defaultClient();
AmazonDynamoDBClient ddbClient = new AmazonDynamoDBClient();
```

**Example of creating a client in version 2\.x**  

```
DynamoDbClient ddbClient = DynamoDbClient.create();
DynamoDbClient ddbClient = DynamoDbClient.builder().build();
```

## Client Configuration<a name="client-configuration"></a>

In 1\.x, SDK client configuration was modified by setting a `ClientConfiguration` instance on the client or client builder\. In version 2\.x, the client configuration is split into separate configuration classes\. The separate configuration classes enable you to configure different HTTP clients for async versus synchronous clients but still use the same `ClientOverrideConfiguration` class\.

**Example of client configuration in version 1\.x**  

```
AmazonDynamoDBClientBuilder.standard()
.withClientConfiguration(clientConfiguration)
.build()
```

**Example of synchronous client configuration in version 2\.x**  

```
ProxyConfiguration.Builder proxyConfig = ProxyConfiguration.builder();

ApacheHttpClient.Builder httpClientBuilder =
        ApacheHttpClient.builder()
                        .proxyConfiguration(proxyConfig.build());

ClientOverrideConfiguration.Builder overrideConfig =
        ClientOverrideConfiguration.builder();

DynamoDbClient client =
        DynamoDbClient.builder()
                      .httpClientBuilder(httpClientBuilder)
                      .overrideConfiguration(overrideConfig.build())
                      .build();
```

**Example of asynchronous client configuration in version 2\.x**  

```
NettyNioAsyncHttpClient.Builder httpClientBuilder =
        NettyNioAsyncHttpClient.builder();

ClientOverrideConfiguration.Builder overrideConfig =
        ClientOverrideConfiguration.builder();

ClientAsyncConfiguration.Builder asyncConfig =
        ClientAsyncConfiguration.builder();

DynamoDbAsyncClient client =
        DynamoDbAsyncClient.builder()
                           .httpClientBuilder(httpClientBuilder)
                           .overrideConfiguration(overrideConfig.build())
                           .asyncConfiguration(asyncConfig.build())
                           .build();
```

For a complete mapping of client configuration methods between 1\.x and 2\.x, see the AWS SDK for Java 2\.x [changelog](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/blob/master/docs/LaunchChangelog.md#13-sdk-client-configuration)\.

## Setter Methods<a name="setter-methods"></a>

In the AWS SDK for Java 2\.x, setter method names donâ€™t include the "set" or "with" prefix\. For example, \*\.withEndpoint\(\) is now just \*\.endpoint\(\)\.

**Example of using setting methods in 1\.x**  

```
AmazonDynamoDB client = AmazonDynamoDBClientBuilder.standard()
        		.withRegion("us-east-1")
        		.build();
```

**Example of using setting methods in 2\.x**  

```
DynamoDbClient client = DynamoDbClient.builder()
        		.region(Region.US_EAST_1)
        		.build();
```

## Class Names<a name="class-names"></a>

All client class names are now fully camel cased and no longer prefixed by "Amazon"\. These changes are aligned with names used in the AWS CLI\. For a full list of client name changes, see the AWS SDK for Java 2\.x [changelog](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/blob/master/docs/LaunchChangelog.md#63-client-names)\.

**Example of class names in 1\.x**  

```
AmazonDynamoDB
AWSACMPCAAsyncClient
```

**Example of class names in 2\.x**  

```
DynamoDbClient
AcmAsyncClient
```

## Region Class<a name="region-class"></a>

The AWS SDK for Java version 1\.x had multiple `Region` and `Regions` classes, both in the core package and in many of the service packages\. `Region` and `Regions` classes in version 2\.x are now collapsed into one core class, `Region`\.

**Example Region and Regions classes in 1\.x**  

```
com.amazonaws.regions.Region
com.amazonaws.regions.Regions
com.amazonaws.services.ec2.model.Region
```

**Example Region class in 2\.x**  

```
software.amazon.awssdk.regions.Region
```

For more details about changes related to using the `Region` class, see [Region class name changes](migration-client-region.md)\.

## Immutable POJOs<a name="immutable-classes"></a>

Clients and operation request and response objects are now immutable and cannot be changed after creation\. To reuse a request or response variable, you must build a new object to assign to it\.

**Example of updating a request object in 1\.x**  

```
DescribeAlarmsRequest request = new DescribeAlarmsRequest();
DescribeAlarmsResult response = cw.describeAlarms(request);

request.setNextToken(response.getNextToken());
```

**Example of updating a request object in 2\.x**  

```
DescribeAlarmsRequest request = DescribeAlarmsRequest.builder().build();
DescribeAlarmsResponse response = cw.describeAlarms(request);

request = DescribeAlarmsRequest.builder()
        .nextToken(response.nextToken())
        .build();
```

## Streaming Operations<a name="streaming-operations"></a>

Streaming operations such as the Amazon S3 `getObject` and `putObject` methods now support non\-blocking I/O\. As a result, the request and response POJOs no longer take `InputStream` as a parameter\. Instead the request object accepts `RequestBody`, which is a stream of bytes\. The asynchronous client accepts `AsyncRequestBody`\.

**Example of Amazon S3 putObject operation in 1\.x**  

```
s3client.putObject(BUCKET, KEY, new File(file_path));
```

**Example of Amazon S3 putObject operation in 2\.x**  

```
s3client.putObject(PutObjectRequest.builder()
                                 .bucket(BUCKET)
                                 .key(KEY)
                                 .build(),
                 RequestBody.of(Paths.get("myfile.in")));
```

In parallel, the response object accepts `ResponseTransformer` for synchronous clients and `AsyncResponseTransformer` for asynchronous clients\.

**Example of Amazon S3 getObject operation in 1\.x**  

```
S3Object o = s3.getObject(bucket, key);
S3ObjectInputStream s3is = o.getObjectContent();
FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(new File(key));
```

**Example of Amazon S3 getObject operation in 2\.x**  

```
s3client.getObject(GetObjectRequest.builder().bucket(bucket).key(key).build(),
		ResponseTransformer.toFile(Paths.get("key")));
```

## Exception changes<a name="exceptions-changes"></a>

Exception class names, and their structures and relationships, have also changed\. `software.amazon.awssdk.core.exception.SdkException` is the new base `Exception` class that all the other exceptions extend\.

For a full list of the 2\.x exception class names mapped to the 1\.x exceptions, see [Exception class name changes](migration-exception-changes.md)\.

## Service\-Specific Changes<a name="service-changes"></a>

### Amazon S3 Operation Name Changes<a name="s3-operations-name"></a>

Many of the operation names for the Amazon S3 client have changed in the AWS SDK for Java 2\.x\. In version 1\.x, the Amazon S3 client is not generated directly from the service API\. This results in inconsistency between the SDK operations and the service API\. In version 2\.x, we now generate the Amazon S3 client to be more consistent with the service API\.

**Example of Amazon S3 client operation in 1\.x**  

```
changeObjectStorageClass
```

**Example of Amazon S3 client operation in 2\.x**  

```
copyObject
```

**Example of Amazon S3 client operation in the Amazon S3 service API**  

```
CopyObject
```

For a full list of the operation name mappings, see the AWS SDK for Java 2\.x [changelog](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/blob/master/docs/LaunchChangelog.md#4-service-changes)\.

### Cross\-region access<a name="cross-region-access"></a>

For security best practices, cross\-region access is no longer supported for single clients\.

In version 1\.x, services such as Amazon S3, Amazon SNS, and Amazon SQS allowed access to resources across Region boundaries\. This is no longer allowed in version 2\.x using the same client\. If you need to access a resource in a different region, you must create a client in that region and retrieve the resource using the appropriate client\.
