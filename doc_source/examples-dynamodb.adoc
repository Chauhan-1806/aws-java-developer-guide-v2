--

This section provides examples that show you how to program link:dynamodb/["pass:q[[.shared\]`DDB`]", type="marketing"] by
using the {sdkjavav2}.

The following examples include only the code needed to demonstrate each technique. The
{url-awsdocs-github}aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/javav2[complete example code is available on GitHub].
From there, you can download a single source file or clone the repository locally to get all the
examples to build and run.
